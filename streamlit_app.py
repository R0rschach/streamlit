### EA Rewards and Responsibilities

EAs are playing a very critical role in the Huma Protocol. To prevent rogue EA, they are required to provide meaningful contributions to the liquidity pool so they have enough skin in the game. 

At the same time, they should be properly rewarded for the hard work of underwriting those requests and taking the risk. So they are taking a percentage of the pool income too. The share can be configured for each pool.

## Example: Request Finance Invoice Factoring
In order to showcase the Evaluation Agent's (EA) capabilities, let’s build a simple EA for factoring Request Finance invoices.

Request Finance is one of the largest web3 finance platforms built on top of the Request Network protocol, with over $300 million in crypto payments sent using their invoicing features. By partnering with Huma, Request Finance tokenizes their invoices into ERC721 receivables that can be factored by lending pools on the Huma Protocol, giving users immediate access to their future income.

At its core, a receivable is a future payment contract with immutable metadata that can be verified by other trusted or trustless sources. Any source of income can be turned into a receivable and underwritten by an EA. EAs extract a number of metadata fields from Request Finance’s receivables including estimated payer address, expected payment amount, and due date and verify them against on-chain historical transactions and Request Network Protocol’s data. Once it has extracted all the data, an EA can apply whatever models and rules it has configured to approve the invoices for factoring.

st.write("""
### A simple rule based EA

Most EAs are driven by AI models, but to make it simple let’s use a set of heuristic rules to demonstrate how EA works:

A significant portion of invoices on Request Network are settled on the Ethereum Mainnet. These payment records are on-chain and accessible for analysis. Leveraging this information, we can craft a set of heuristic rules concentrating on three key aspects of factoring risk: payer quality, payee quality, and the quality of the relationship between payer and payee.

* Payer Quality:
  * Payer has a history of making multiple on-chain payments
  * Payer's earliest transaction dates back a considerable time period
  * Payer has been active in recent weeks, with multiple transactions
  * Payer has a diverse payment history, involving several unique * payees
* Payee Quality:
  * Payee has a history of receiving multiple on-chain payments from different payers
  * Payee has received a substantial amount in total on-chain payments
  * Payee has a recent history of receiving a significant amount on-chain
* Payer and Payee Relationship Quality:
  * The payer and payee pair share a history of previous on-chain interactions

Based on these assumptions, we can create a set of rules to filter out those requests that don't meet the quality bar. And let the ones qualified to do invoice factoring. 

Let’s look at this table that demonstrates the impact of different filter rules. Each rule was evaluated individually, measuring the number of requests, payers, and payees that were filtered out. The combined impact of these rules showcases EA’s ability to analyze data and create sophisticated evaluation strategies.
